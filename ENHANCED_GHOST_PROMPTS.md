# Enhanced Ghost Mannequin Prompts - Improved Negative Prompting

## Problem Identified

The QA system detected that the generated result was not a proper ghost mannequin:
```
QA correction needed: Ensure the ghost mannequin effect is applied to remove the model from the image, showing only the garment.
```

The issue was that Flash 2.5 was returning the source image instead of creating the invisible mannequin effect.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Insufficient Ghost Mannequin Definition**: The distilled prompt wasn't explicitly defining what a "ghost mannequin" means
2. **Missing E-commerce Context**: Flash didn't understand this was product photography for online retail  
3. **Weak Negative Prompting**: No guidance on achieving the invisible mannequin effect
4. **Unclear Dimensional Instructions**: Vague descriptions of the 3D transformation needed

## ✅ Enhancements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Meta-Prompt Instructions**

**Before**:
```
Write in natural, flowing sentences - avoid bullets or lists. Include:
• Studio lighting and ghost mannequin setup
• Specific garment details from the facts
```

**After**:
```
CRITICAL: Include these essential elements:
• **Ghost Mannequin Definition**: Clearly state this is an "invisible mannequin" or "ghost mannequin" effect showing only the garment with dimensional form but no visible person or mannequin
• **E-commerce Photography**: Emphasize this is professional product photography suitable for online retail
• **Dimensional Form**: The garment appears filled with invisible human form, showing natural drape and structure
```

### 2. **Smart Negative Prompting Guidance**

Added explicit instructions to the meta-prompt:
```
IMPORTANT NEGATIVE GUIDANCE: Instead of saying "remove person" or "remove mannequin", positively describe the desired result as "professional e-commerce ghost mannequin photography" and "garment displays dimensional form with no visible person or mannequin".
```

This follows best practices for AI prompting:
- ✅ **Positive descriptions** of desired outcomes
- ✅ **E-commerce context** for better understanding
- ❌ **Avoid negative commands** like "remove X" or "don't show Y"

### 3. **Updated Master Template**

Added new section to the comprehensive template:
```markdown
## GHOST MANNEQUIN DEFINITION:

This is professional e-commerce ghost mannequin photography - the garment displays perfect dimensional form with no visible person, mannequin, or model. The invisible mannequin effect shows how clothing appears when worn while maintaining complete transparency of the supporting form.

## PROFESSIONAL NEGATIVE PROMPTING:

Achieve the ghost mannequin effect through positive description rather than negative commands. Instead of "remove person" or "remove mannequin", describe the desired result: "professional e-commerce product photography showing the garment with dimensional form and invisible support".
```

### 4. **Enhanced Fallback Prompts**

Updated the static fallback prompt to include ghost mannequin language:

**Before**:
```
The garment should appear as if worn by a transparent form, creating natural volume and structure...
```

**After**:
```
Create professional e-commerce ghost mannequin photography showing a [category] with perfect dimensional form... This is invisible mannequin product photography where the garment displays natural fit and drape with no visible person, mannequin, or model.
```

## Key Terminology Changes

| Old Language | New Language | Why Better |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| "transparent form" | "invisible mannequin" | Industry standard term |
| "worn by invisible person" | "ghost mannequin effect" | E-commerce specific |
| "remove model" | "no visible person or mannequin" | Positive description |
| "dimensional display" | "professional product photography" | Clear context |

## Expected Results

With these enhancements, the distilled prompts should now:

1. **✅ Clearly Define Ghost Mannequin**: Flash 2.5 understands exactly what effect to create
2. **✅ Provide E-commerce Context**: Better understanding of the commercial application
3. **✅ Use Smart Negatives**: Positive descriptions instead of removal commands
4. **✅ Emphasize Dimensional Form**: Clear instructions for the 3D transformation
5. **✅ Maintain Professional Quality**: Commercial-grade photography standards

## Testing Validation

The next test run should show:
- Generated images with proper ghost mannequin effect
- No visible person, mannequin, or model in results
- Dimensional garment form with realistic drape
- Professional e-commerce photography quality
- QA system approval (no correction needed)

## Implementation Status

**✅ Complete** - All enhancements are now active in the system:
- `lib/ghost/prompt-generator.ts` - Enhanced meta-prompt instructions
- Master template updated with ghost mannequin definitions
- Fallback prompts include explicit invisible mannequin language
- Smart negative prompting guidance implemented

The distilled prompt approach now includes industry best practices for ghost mannequin generation with professional negative prompting techniques.
