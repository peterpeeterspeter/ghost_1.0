# Session Memory - Ghost Mannequin Pipeline Enhancements

**Session Date**: September 21-22, 2025  
**Status**: Distilled Prompts Successfully Implemented with Outstanding Issue  
**Server**: Running at http://localhost:3001  

## ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments Completed

### 1. **Distilled Prompt Implementation**
Successfully implemented a meta-prompt approach that uses Gemini Pro 2.5 to distill the massive 5,000+ character master template into focused 350-word prompts.

**Architecture Implemented**:
```
FactsV3 JSON ‚Üí Gemini Pro 2.5 (Meta-Prompt Engine) ‚Üí 350-word Natural Prompt ‚Üí Gemini Flash 2.5 ‚Üí Ghost Mannequin
```

**Key Files Modified**:
- `lib/ghost/prompt-generator.ts` - Enhanced meta-prompt instructions
- Added explicit ghost mannequin definitions and e-commerce context
- Implemented smart negative prompting (positive descriptions vs "remove X")

### 2. **Enhanced Ghost Mannequin Instructions**
Fixed the core issue where Flash 2.5 was returning source images instead of creating ghost mannequin effects.

**Improvements Made**:
- ‚úÖ **Explicit Ghost Mannequin Definition**: "invisible mannequin effect showing only the garment with dimensional form but no visible person or mannequin"
- ‚úÖ **E-commerce Context**: "professional product photography suitable for online retail"  
- ‚úÖ **Smart Negative Prompting**: Instead of "remove person/mannequin", use positive descriptions like "garment displays dimensional form with invisible support"
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Dimensional Instructions**: Clear guidance on how garment should appear "filled with invisible human form"

### 3. **Performance Improvements**
- **Token Reduction**: ~70% reduction from 5,000+ chars to ~1,665 chars
- **Quality Improvements**: QA system now passes on first iteration
- **Natural Language**: Flowing sentences vs technical specifications

### 4. **Evidence of Success**
From server logs showing the improvements working:
```
Generate a professional, commercial-grade product photograph for an e-commerce platform, showcasing a men's top using the ghost mannequin technique...

This is professional e-commerce ghost mannequin photography; the garment must display a realistic, dimensional form as if worn by an invisible person, with no visible mannequin or model.
```

**QA Results**: 
```
[2025-09-21T17:04:11.552Z] QA passed on iteration 1
Ghost mannequin processing completed successfully
```

## üìã Current System State

### Files Enhanced
1. **`lib/ghost/prompt-generator.ts`**:
   - Enhanced meta-prompt with ghost mannequin definitions
   - Added professional negative prompting guidance
   - Updated master template with explicit instructions
   - Improved fallback prompt with e-commerce language

2. **Documentation Created**:
   - `DISTILLED_PROMPTS.md` - Comprehensive implementation guide
   - `ENHANCED_GHOST_PROMPTS.md` - Problem analysis and solutions
   - `test-enhanced-prompts.js` - Test demonstration script

### System Performance
- **Prompt Length**: 1,665 characters (target: ~1,750 for 350 words) ‚úÖ
- **Processing Time**: Meta-prompt generation adds ~15 seconds but improves overall quality
- **QA Approval Rate**: Now passing on first iteration (was failing before)
- **Token Efficiency**: 70% reduction vs. full master template

## üö® Outstanding Issue to Address Next Session

### **Problem**: Image Not Full Frontal View
**Issue Identified**: The generated ghost mannequin images are not showing a proper direct frontal view for e-commerce photography standards.

**Current Status**:
- Ghost mannequin effect is working (no visible person/mannequin) ‚úÖ
- Professional quality is achieved ‚úÖ  
- QA system approves results ‚úÖ
- **BUT**: Camera angle/positioning is not optimal for e-commerce

**Analysis Needed**:
1. **Check current prompt specificity** about frontal positioning
2. **Examine reference image influence** on final angle
3. **Consider explicit camera positioning** terminology

**Potential Solutions to Try**:
- Add explicit "direct frontal view, straight-on camera angle" to meta-prompt instructions
- Include "0-degree angle, face-forward perspective" terminology
- Check if reference image positioning affects result angle
- Test with single image vs. dual image approach

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Session Action Plan

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Analyze Current Results**: Review specific angle issues in generated images
2. **Enhance Frontal View Instructions**: Add explicit camera positioning to meta-prompt
3. **Test Variations**: 
   - Enhanced frontal view prompts
   - Single vs. dual reference image impact
   - Camera angle terminology effectiveness

### Investigation Questions
- What specific angle is currently being generated? (3/4 view, side, slightly turned?)
- Are both reference images (cleaned flatlay + on-model) influencing the angle?
- Should we add photography-specific positioning terms?

### Files to Modify (Next Session)
- `lib/ghost/prompt-generator.ts` - Add frontal view positioning instructions
- Possibly test with different reference image configurations

## üíª Environment State

**Server**: http://localhost:3001 (running on restart)  
**Pipeline**: 6-stage processing with consolidation and QA  
**Model**: Using freepik-gemini (Gemini Flash 2.5 via Freepik API)  
**Status**: Fully operational with distilled prompt approach active  

## üéØ Success Metrics Achieved

- ‚úÖ Distilled prompts generating at target length (~1,665 chars)
- ‚úÖ Ghost mannequin effect working (no visible people/mannequins)
- ‚úÖ QA system approval on first iteration
- ‚úÖ Professional e-commerce quality maintained
- ‚úÖ Smart negative prompting implemented
- ‚úÖ Token efficiency improved by ~70%

**Final Outstanding**: Frontal view positioning optimization

---

**Ready for next session**: All core distilled prompt improvements are complete and working. Only frontal view angle optimization remains to perfect the e-commerce presentation.
